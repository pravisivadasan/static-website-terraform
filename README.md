Terraform module which provision required AWS resources to host a performant and secured static website.

## Features

This Terraform module creates the following AWS resources:

* **AWS Certificate Manager**: wildcard certificate for your domain.
* **S3**
  * Bucket #1: to store logs.
  * Bucket #2: to store the content (`example.com`).
  * Bucket #3: to redirect a different subdomain to the main domain (e.g., `www.example.com` redirected to `example.com`).
* **CloudFront**
  * Distribution #1: to frontend the website.
  * Distribution #2: to frontend the subdomain that will be redirected to the main domain.
* **Route53** record sets pointing to the two CloudFront distributions.

## Requirements

* This module is meant for use with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12+. It has not been tested with previous versions of Terraform.
* An AWS account and your credentials (`aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`) configured. There are several ways to do this (environment variables, shared credentials file, etc.): my preference is to store them in a [credential file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html). More information in the [AWS Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html) documentation.
* Your domain already configured as a hosted zone on Route53.

## Usage

```HCL
provider "aws" {
  version                 = "~> 2.0"
  region                  = "eu-west-3"
  shared_credentials_file = "~/.aws/credentials"
}

module "aws_static_website" {
  source = "cloudmaniac/static-website/aws"

  website-domain-main     = "example.com"
  website-domain-redirect = "www.example.com"
}
```

Although AWS services are available in many locations, some of them require the `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) region to be configured:

* To use an ACM certificate with Amazon CloudFront, you must request or import the certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) region. ACM certificates in this region associated with a CloudFront distribution are distributed to all the geographic locations configured for that distribution.

For that reason, the module includes an aliased provider definition to create supplemental resources in the `us-east-1` region when required. Remaining resources from the module will inherit default (un-aliased) provider configurations from the parent.
